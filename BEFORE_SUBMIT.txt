REMEMBER;
    - when calling system functions, check their return values!

    - remove all prints from all C files!
      (if something is printed when it should not be, tester will fail!)
    
    - go over 'common mistakes' from drive!


open questions:
  - are we allowed to leave 'printK' commands?

testing:
  - 'common mistakes' from drive!
  - multilpe channels
  - multiple device files
  - overlap between channels of different device files

  - read/write before channel is set
  - read/write with invalid arguments
  - channel set with invalid arguments
